"""Locks in the Loan Documents builder.

Two guarantees:
1. The committed template (app/templates/loan_documents.html.j2) holds ONLY
   placeholders — none of the executed example's deal data may appear in it or
   in any rendered output. The repo is public, so even this test cannot carry
   those strings: the token list lives in the git-ignored
   tools/_loandocs_audit_tokens.json (present on the machine that builds the
   template, where the risk lives) and the tripwire tests skip without it.
2. Rendering with confirmed terms produces the whole package with the deal's
   figures in the right places, and the Memo of Settlement's "To be disbursed"
   is recomputed from the lines (never copied).
