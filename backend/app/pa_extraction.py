"""Document extraction for the Participation Agreement Builder.

Reuses the same Claude subscription usage-token (OAuth) authentication as the
credit-memo extraction (see ``extraction.py``) — never a pay-per-token API key.
The prompt here is tuned for participation deals: it reads the loan & security
agreement / term sheet (and an optional participation term sheet) and returns the
fields needed to fill the Participation Agreement and its Key Terms exhibit.

PROMPT = """You are an analyst at South River Capital LLC preparing a loan PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT. South River ("Lender") originates a loan to a borrower and sells an undivided fractional participation interest in that loan to a Participant (by default "Brookridge Opportunistic Credit Fund, LP").

You have been given one or more deal documents, which may include any combination of: a South River credit memorandum prepared for the loan, a Loan and Security Agreement, a promissory note, a term sheet, a commitment letter, a closing/settlement statement, or a participation term sheet. A credit memorandum is an excellent source for the borrower, the total loan amount, the interest rate, the origination fee, and the funding/closing date.

Read ALL documents together and extract the fields below. Use the most authoritative source for each. Return ONLY raw JSON, no markdown, no backticks:

{"borrower_name":null,"agreement_date":null,"loan_agreement_date":null,"loan_amount":0,"loan_number":null,"interest_rate_apr":0,"origination_fee_pct":0,"participant_name":null,"participation_percentage":0,"participant_loan_amount":0,"late_fee_share_pct":0,"servicing_fee_pct":0,"participant_signatory_name":null,"participant_signatory_title":null,"notes":null}

Rules:
- Numbers must be plain numbers with no "$", commas, or "%": loan_amount 675000 (not "$675,000"); interest_rate_apr 12 (not "12%"); origination_fee_pct 2 means 2%. Use 0 when a number is not stated. Use null for missing strings.
- borrower_name: the borrower on the loan (the athlete/obligor).
- loan_amount: the TOTAL principal amount of the loan (the whole facility), not the participant's share.
- loan_agreement_date: the date OF the Loan and Security Agreement (the loan documents), formatted "Month D, YYYY" (e.g. "October 6, 2025").
- agreement_date: the date the participation agreement is made / the closing or funding date if stated, formatted "Month D, YYYY". If no such date appears, return null.
- loan_number: the loan or account number if shown (digits as a string).
- interest_rate_apr: the loan's stated interest rate / APR as a number.
- origination_fee_pct: the origination fee percentage if stated.
- The PARTICIPATION-SPECIFIC terms are usually set by South River separately and are OFTEN NOT in the borrower's loan documents. Only fill them if a document (e.g. a participation term sheet) explicitly states them; otherwise leave them 0 / null: participant_name, participation_percentage (participant's % of the loan), participant_loan_amount (the participant's dollar share / purchase price), late_fee_share_pct (participant's share of late fees), servicing_fee_pct, participant_signatory_name, participant_signatory_title.
- participant_name: only set if a participant OTHER than the default is clearly named in the documents; otherwise null.
- notes: one or two short sentences flagging anything ambiguous, conflicting, or worth the analyst's attention (e.g. multiple candidate dates, rate expressed as a range). Keep it brief; null if nothing notable.
- Do not invent values. If a figure is not in the documents, return 0 or null and (if relevant) mention it in notes."""
