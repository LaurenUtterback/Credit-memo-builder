}

RULES — these are load-bearing:

1. SALARY is the GUARANTEED portion of the season's compensation ONLY: the
   guaranteed base salary PLUS any bonus that is guaranteed and paid every year
   of the contract (annual signing-bonus installments, guaranteed yearly roster
   bonuses). Exclude non-guaranteed incentives, one-time bonuses and
   endorsements. When installments differ season to season, use the one
   SCHEDULED FOR THE SEASON BEING UNDERWRITTEN — never an average, never
   another season's. If the contract states a Paragraph 5 salary but an
   addendum guarantees only part of it, salary is the GUARANTEED part.

2. salary_guaranteed is TRUE only for a clean, unconditional guarantee. If the
   guarantee is conditional, partial, voidable (failure to report, refusal to
   play, non-football injury, retirement, breach), or a one-way/limited SPC,
   set it FALSE and quote the condition in salary_guarantee_note. This flips
   which structures make sense, so do not round it up to true.

3. BONUS_EVENTS are dated lump payments that fall OUTSIDE the regular salary
   cadence: signing-bonus installments, roster bonuses, workout bonuses,
   endorsement milestones, deferred payments. Give each its real payment date
   from the schedule. NEVER include an amount here that you already counted in
   salary — if a guaranteed annual installment is inside salary, leave it out
   of bonus_events. Mark guaranteed=false for anything contingent.

4. TIMING: pay_frequency is "weekly", "semimonthly" or "monthly" — only if the
   documents actually state how the player is paid. season_start / season_end
   are the first and last SCHEDULED PAY DATES of the season, in ISO form, again
   only if stated. If the documents are silent, return null and say so in
   pay_election_note — a league default will be applied instead. Do NOT invent
   a cadence. If the player has ELECTED a pay schedule (e.g. an NBA player
   electing payment over 12 months instead of the season), record that election
   in pay_election_note; it matters more than the league default.

5. PFS: when a Personal Financial Statement is among the documents, fill "pfs"
   with the SAME fields the credit-memo extraction captures (else "pfs": null):
   * pfs_date is the date the PFS was PREPARED (a "Completed on:" line, a date
     printed on page 1, or the signature date), ISO yyyy-mm-dd. Never the
     credit report date, the contract date, or today's date.
   * Capture EVERY line of the Annual Expenditures section, mapped by line:
     mortgage payments -> mortgage_payments, automobile payments ->
     auto_payments, insurance premiums -> insurance, alimony/child support ->
     alimony, student loans -> student_loans, interest & principal on loans ->
     interest_principal_loans, HOA dues -> hoa_payments, and every other
     expenditure line (exact label and amount) into other_expenses. Amounts are
     ANNUAL. Do NOT include income taxes or ordinary living expenses — those
     are computed.
   * debt_schedule is the PER-LOAN detail from the PFS's own detail schedules,
     which appear on a later page than the page-1 summary totals: Schedule D
     (real estate & mortgage debt), Schedule F (notes payable) and Schedule G
     (contract-based notes payable). One object per financed debt, omitting
     nothing. category is EXACTLY "mortgage_debt" (any Schedule D row),
     "notes_payable_others" (F) or "notes_payable_contract" (G). balance and
     payment are positive numbers (payment 0 when the row shows none —
     revolving lines such as credit cards typically show none).
     payment_period: "monthly" when the document indicates monthly, the stated
     period copied verbatim when it names one ("per game check", "annual"),
     "" when the form shows an amount but no period — NEVER invent a period.
     Copy origination and maturity VERBATIM even when they look malformed; ""
     when blank. ROW ALIGNMENT: these are tables, and the text layer often
     reaches you with columns out of order — every figure you return for a
     debt must come from the SAME TABLE ROW as that debt's lender (anchor on
     the lender name and the outstanding amount, and read across). If you
     cannot confidently tell which row a payment or maturity belongs to,
     return 0 / "" rather than attaching it to the wrong debt.
   other_debt_annual is your OWN summed total of the borrower's annual
   non-facility debt service (mortgage, autos, alimony/child support, student
   loans, other notes, HOA) — it is used only as a FALLBACK when "pfs" carries
   no usable lines; the server recomputes debt service from "pfs" the way the
   credit memo does, stale-statement roll-forward included.

6. EXIT: fill expected_exit_date / expected_exit_label ONLY when the documents
   indicate repayment depends on a specific EVENT rather than on income — a
   contract extension or new contract being signed, an endorsement closing, a
   property sale, a refinance. expected_exit_label is a SHORT NOUN PHRASE
   naming the event, at most 8 words ("contract extension signing", "sale of
   the Miami property") — never a sentence and never your reasoning; that
   belongs in notes. Set the label even if no date is stated. If repayment
   simply comes from salary, leave both null.

7. presented_type is how the loan is structured AS PRESENTED, in the documents'
   own words ("Full balloon", "Interest only with balloon", "Fully amortized").

8. Dates are ISO yyyy-mm-dd. Amounts are plain numbers, no symbols or commas.
   Percentages are numbers (15 for 15%). Use null for anything the documents do
   not state — NEVER guess, and never carry a figure over from a different
   season or a different loan.

9. NOTES is read by a person in a single glance. Give at most 5 short items,
   semicolon-separated, covering only what would change the structuring
   decision or what you were unsure about — a conflict between documents, a
   figure you had to interpret, a repayment source that is not the salary.
   Do not restate figures that are already in the fields above, and do not
   summarize the deal.

1. The athlete's compensation for the current/upcoming season as Spotrac's CAP HIT for that season.

Use only the season being underwritten — exclude other seasons, one-time or performance/incentive bonuses Spotrac does not count for the season, and endorsements.
2. The athlete's CURRENT team as Spotrac lists it — the team the athlete is signed/rostered with now, never a former team from a transaction history.
3. The league the athlete plays in (NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, MLS, ...).

Return ONLY raw JSON, no markdown, no backticks: {{"spotrac_salary":0,"season":null,"team":null,"league":null,"note":null}}
- spotrac_salary: that season cap hit (or composed equivalent) as a number. Return 0 if the page cannot support a figure (no contract data, contract expired, or the page describes a DIFFERENT person than the borrower — check name, sport, team).
- season: the season/year the figure belongs to (e.g. "2026"), else null.
- team / league: exactly as Spotrac lists them, else null. Return null for BOTH if the page describes a different person than the borrower.
- note: 1-2 short plain-text sentences an underwriter can read: the figure's composition as Spotrac shows it (base salary + prorated signing bonus + other bonuses), and how much of the season's compensation Spotrac marks as GUARANTEED — or why no figure could be determined. Never use markdown.
