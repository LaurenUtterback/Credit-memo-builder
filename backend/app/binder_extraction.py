You have been given the uploaded PDF file(s) listed below, in upload order. Together they contain the SIGNED/EXECUTED closing package and possibly separate insurance documents.

Files:
"""

SORT_PROMPT_BODY = """
Every page of every file has been STAMPED by the system with a red label at the top: "FILE i - PAGE n / N", where i is the file's number in the list above and n is the page within that file. READ THE STAMP ON EACH PAGE and take file_index/first_page/last_page from the stamps — never by counting pages yourself.

Identify every distinct document and exactly which pages it spans. Return ONLY raw JSON, no markdown, no backticks:

{"documents":[{"file_index":1,"first_page":1,"last_page":2,"category":"package_cover","title":null}],"notes":null}

Rules:
- file_index is 1-based in the upload order listed above. first_page/last_page are 1-based page numbers WITHIN that file, inclusive, read from the stamps.
- Account for EVERY page of every file exactly once — no gaps, no overlaps. Attach a blank or unidentifiable page to the document it most likely belongs with and mention it in notes.
- CLASSIFY EACH PAGE BY WHAT IS PRINTED ON IT, never by an expected pattern. These are scans of a signed set: a page can be missing (double feed) or scanned twice, so the usual rhythm (cover, title sheet, document, title sheet, document, ...) CAN BREAK. A title sheet is a nearly blank page showing only a document's name (possibly with the borrower's name, a logo, or a kicker line). A document's own pages carry body text, tables, or signature blocks. Never call a page a title sheet because one is "due" — look at the page.
- South River's generated packages also print their own footer "PAGE x OF y" on every package page. If those printed numbers skip or repeat between consecutive scanned pages (e.g. PAGE 22 then PAGE 24), the scan is missing or repeating a package page: say exactly that in notes (e.g. "the printed footer skips from 22 to 24 — package page 23 is missing from the scan").
- category must be one of:
  "package_cover" — the closing package's own overall cover/summary page and its document-index pages, AND every standalone title/cover sheet: a page that is mostly blank and shows only a document's name (possibly with the borrower's name, a logo, or a kicker line) announcing the document that follows. A title sheet is ALWAYS its own "package_cover" entry — NEVER included in the following document's span, even though it belongs to that document — because the binder adds its own title pages and keeping them would print two covers per section. This applies equally when a file holds a SINGLE document whose first page is such a cover/title sheet: that first page is "package_cover" too.
  "affidavit" — Business Entity Affidavit (sworn statement).
  "note" — Promissory Note.
  "repayment_schedule" — the Note's repayment/payment schedule (Exhibit A, "Loan Repayments by Month"). Treat it as its OWN document even though it is the Note's exhibit — the binder format separates them.
  "lsa" — Loan and Security Agreement, INCLUDING its Exhibit A definitions.
  "guaranty" — Guaranty.
  "settlement" — Memo of Settlement.
  "ucc" — UCC Financing Statement, including its Exhibit A.
  "direction_letter" — the Payment Direction Letter: the Borrower's letter TO THE TEAM directing contract payments to the lender's account. Other letters and authorizations (bank-information releases, broker authorizations, wire instructions) are NOT the direction letter — classify those "other".
  "insurance" — insurance paperwork: quotes, applications, policies, binders, death/disability/disgrace coverage.
  "duplicate" — a page span that repeats a document that already appears elsewhere in the uploads (for example the same insurance application scanned at the end of the package AND uploaded as its own file). Keep the clearest copy under its real category and mark every other copy "duplicate", saying in notes what it duplicates; duplicates are left out of the binder.
  "other" — anything that is none of the above.
- title: null for the known categories; for "other" give a short title suitable for a table of contents row.
- notes: short sentences about anything ambiguous, missing, duplicated, or unidentifiable. Null if nothing notable."""

    rhythm no matter how emphatically the prompt says not to — a page read
