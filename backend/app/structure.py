"""Deal structuring — propose a repayment structure from the borrower's cash flow.

Every other builder in this app takes the loan's structure as GIVEN. This module
derives it. It projects the athlete's month-by-month cash flow from how their
league actually pays, then scores candidate structures against that projection.

The two variables that decide a structure
-----------------------------------------
1. TIMING   — when cash actually arrives (league pay cadence, bonus dates).
2. CERTAINTY— whether that cash is contractually locked or contingent.

    dated & certain + recurring  -> amortize on the pay cadence
    dated & certain + one event  -> bullet maturing just after the event
    undated / contingent         -> bullet + interest reserve (nothing to service)

Non-guaranteed income argues for amortizing FAST while the money flows (a cut or
injury ends it); guaranteed money can support a balloon.

Rules encoded here
------------------
S1. Taxes follow the CHECKS: 45% of each month's gross (calculations rule 1,
    distributed by pay date rather than annually). Bonus cash is taxed too.
S2. Ordinary living expenses are 10% of annual salary + other income, spread
    EVENLY over 12 months (calculations rule 2's annual total, but living costs
    do not stop in the offseason, so they are not tied to pay timing).
S3. The salary spread is the GUARANTEED season compensation only (rule 9), and
    it stops after ``contract_end`` — no season is projected past the contract.
S4. Coverage is reported two ways. ``coverage`` is the strict same-month test
    (payment vs that month's cash). ``cushion_coverage`` tests against the
    running surplus, because an athlete banks in-season money to live on in the
    offseason. A structure that fails same-month but passes on cushion is viable
    only if the borrower actually reserves — that is a credit judgment, so both
    numbers are always shown rather than collapsed into one verdict.
S5. A maturity date in a DRY month (no salary) is always flagged. The balloon
    should land where the cash is.
S6. Interest accrues actual/365, consistent with calculations.calc_amort.

The agent-commission knob defaults to 0.0 so the projection ties out EXACTLY to
the credit memo's annual cash flow. Setting it is an underwriter override that
deliberately diverges from the memo.
