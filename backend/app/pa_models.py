"""Pydantic models for the Participation Agreement Builder.

Two shapes:

* ``PAExtraction`` — what Claude pulls out of the dropped deal documents (loan &
  security agreement, term sheet, participation term sheet, …). Numbers come
  back as plain numbers; dates as "Month D, YYYY" strings.
* ``PATerms`` — the exact, editable strings that get injected into the
  ``participation_agreement.docx`` template. The frontend pre-fills these from
  the extraction (formatting amounts/percentages) and the user confirms them, so
  what they see in the form is what prints. The Lender is fixed in the template
  (South River Capital LLC / James Plack); the Participant defaults to Brookridge
  but stays editable.
