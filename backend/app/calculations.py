Financial calculations for the credit memo.

This module is the authoritative home for every underwriting rule. The rules
were developed carefully and are locked in by tests/test_calculations.py using
the Alvarado reference deal. Do NOT change a rule here without updating the
tests to match the intended new behavior.

Underwriting rules encoded here
-------------------------------
1.  Taxes are ALWAYS 45% of gross income (salary + other income). Never pulled
    from documents.
2.  Ordinary living expenses are ALWAYS 10% of gross income.
3.  In the Guarantor Analysis cash flow, the Proposed Facility line is the loan
    PRINCIPAL only.
4.  On the Personal Financial Statement, the Proposed Facility is loan + interest
    (the full amount due). Interest comes from the amortization schedule, or
    falls back to a facility total stated in the documents.
5.  Net Worth = Total Assets - Total Liabilities. Always calculated, never copied
    from a stated figure in the documents.
6.  Total Liabilities includes the Proposed Facility (loan + interest).
7.  Alimony / child support is a cash-flow item ONLY (Available for Debt). It is
    never a PFS liability.
8.  Auto loan balances are never a separate PFS liability row (they live inside
    "Notes Payable to: others"). Monthly auto PAYMENTS still appear in the cash flow.
9.  Salary used everywhere is the GUARANTEED portion of compensation only:
    the guaranteed base salary PLUS any bonus that is guaranteed and paid
    every year of the contract (e.g. annual signing-bonus installments,
    guaranteed yearly roster bonuses). Non-guaranteed incentives, one-time
    bonuses, and endorsements stay excluded. When installments differ season
    to season, the amount used is the one SCHEDULED FOR THAT SPECIFIC
    current/upcoming season — never an average, never another season's.
    Reference example: $1,000,000 base + $9,000,000 guaranteed bonus
    scheduled for the season = $10,000,000 salary (never the base alone,
    never the $39,500,000 remaining contract value, and the bonus is not
    double-counted as other income). The total remaining contract value is
    captured separately (Extraction.contract_remaining), shown in Section
    VII, and serves as the guaranteed-earnings basis for rule 10.
10. LTC (Loan-to-Contract) = loan amount / guaranteed earnings, where
    guaranteed earnings is the TOTAL REMAINING contract value when the
    documents provide one (contract_remaining), else the guaranteed season
    salary. Section I's "advance against $X in guaranteed salary" states the
    same figure. The cash flow (rule 1) stays on the season salary.
11. Taxes are NEVER a PFS liability. Even when the Personal Financial Statement
    reports an estimated tax figure (e.g. "Taxes (Est of 35% of ...)"), it is
    excluded from Total Liabilities and from Net Worth.
12. Section VI (Uses of Funds) reproduces EVERY disbursement line provided in the
    documents (fees, payoffs, closing costs, insurance, interest reserve, ...).
    The "To be disbursed to Borrower" and "Net to be Disbursed to Borrower"
    subtotals are always recomputed from the lines, never copied. When the
    documents carry no breakdown, it falls back to gross loan less the
    origination fee from the deal terms.
13. The loan term in months (Section II Action Request) prefers the term stated
    in the documents (a term sheet's "Term: N months"); it falls back to the
    funding-to-maturity span used for the amortization schedule.
14. The memo phrases the borrower as "a Professional <sport> player", so the
    sport value is normalized to drop a leading "professional" — the memo must
    never render "Professional Professional ...".
15. STALE PFS ROLL-FORWARD ("Method A", Lauren's standing rule as of
    2026-08-05, applied to every memo). When the Personal Financial Statement
    is more than a month older than the memo date, each financed debt on its
    detail schedules is rolled forward as

        adjusted balance = reported balance - (monthly payment x months elapsed)

    where months elapsed counts whole payments from the month AFTER the
    statement date through the memo month (10/16/25 -> 7/28/26 = 9). The
    paydown is clamped so a balance never goes below zero and never runs past
    the loan's maturity date. Lines with no scheduled payment (credit cards and
    other revolving debt) and lines whose payment is NOT monthly (e.g. a
    contract note paid per game check) are left exactly as reported. Each
    schedule row's paydown is applied to the page-1 summary liability it rolls
    up into, so Total Liabilities and Net Worth reflect the adjusted figures.
    Known and accepted: the scheduled payment includes interest — and mortgage
    payments on the SureSports PFS form include taxes & insurance — so the
    method understates the true balance. That is deliberate.

    Whether a payment counts as monthly: Schedule D's column is literally
    "Monthly Payment", and Schedule F notes are monthly unless the form says
    otherwise; Schedule F/G's "Amount / Pay Period" column is frequently left
    blank. A CONTRACT-BASED note (Schedule G) is the exception — it is repaid
    out of game checks, so a blank period never counts as monthly there.

    Each debt carries a ``treatment`` the underwriter sets: "roll" (the default
    above), "hold" (carry exactly as the statement reports it), or "zero" (show
    it repaid in full — a payoff at closing, or a debt known to be settled).
    A ZERO-OUT does not depend on the statement being stale: the whole balance
    leaves its summary liability however fresh the PFS is. Debts may also be
    ADDED by hand when extraction misses one, or when the PFS carries no detail
    schedules at all; an added debt must name the summary liability it rolls
    into (``category``) or its paydown has no total to come out of, which is
    reported as a warning rather than applied somewhere arbitrary.
