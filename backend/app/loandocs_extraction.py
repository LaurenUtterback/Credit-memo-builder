"""Document extraction for the Loan Documents builder's Team & Contract fields.

Reuses the same Claude subscription usage-token (OAuth) authentication as the
credit-memo extraction (see ``extraction.py``) — never a pay-per-token API key.
The prompt is tuned to pull the details the closing package needs about the
athlete's employer and playing contract: the team's name and mailing address
(the Payment Direction Letter is mailed there), the league, and how the
contract should be referenced (title + "as of" date) in the Loan & Security
Agreement's Contract definition.

PROMPT = """You are an analyst at South River Capital LLC assembling the CLOSING DOCUMENTS for a loan to a professional athlete. You have been given one or more deal documents, which may include the athlete's professional playing contract (or a summary/addendum of it), a term sheet, a South River credit memorandum, or other loan documents.

Extract the TEAM and CONTRACT details below. They are used two ways: (1) the Loan & Security Agreement defines the "Contract" as: the <contract_title> between <player> and <team> dated <contract date>; and (2) a Payment Direction Letter is MAILED to the team's front office at the address you extract.

Return ONLY raw JSON, no markdown, no backticks:

{"player_name":null,"team_name":null,"team_street":null,"team_city_state_zip":null,"league":null,"contract_title":null,"contract_date":null,"notes":null}

Rules:
- Use null for anything not stated in the documents. Do not invent values.
- player_name: the athlete who is party to the contract.
- team_name: the full club/team name employing the athlete, e.g. "Baltimore Orioles".
- team_street: the street line of the club's mailing address AS STATED in the documents (e.g. "333 West Camden Street"). team_city_state_zip: the rest of that address on one line (e.g. "Baltimore, MD 21201" or "Vancouver, BC V6B 4Y8, Canada"). The letter is physically mailed there, so only use an address that appears in the documents; if none does, return null for both and say so in notes.
- league: the league's usual abbreviation (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLS, WNBA, ...).
- contract_title: a short legal reference for the contract, preferring the document's own title prefixed with the league when helpful — e.g. "MLB Uniform Player's Contract", "NBA Standard Player Contract", or "MLB Professional Contract" when the papers just call it a player contract. Null if you cannot tell.
- contract_date: the date the contract was made / its "as of" date, formatted "YYYY-MM-DD". If the documents show several contract-related dates (signing date vs. effective date), prefer the "dated as of" date and mention the others in notes. Null if not stated.
- notes: one or two short sentences flagging anything missing, ambiguous, or conflicting (e.g. "Team address not shown in the documents", "Contract is an extension dated ..."). Null if nothing notable."""

Rules:
- Numbers must be plain numbers with no "$", commas, or "%": loan_amount 3300000; interest_rate_pct 12.5; origination_fee_pct 3 means 3%. Use 0 when a number is not stated. Use null for missing strings. Do not invent values.
- borrower_name: the borrower/athlete the memo is about.
- The memo's "Address (Season)" line is one string — split it: borrower_street (street line), borrower_city, borrower_state_abbr (2-letter), borrower_zip. borrower_state is the state spelled out from that abbreviation (e.g. FL -> "Florida").
- occupation: phrase it "Professional <Sport> Player" from how the memo describes the borrower (e.g. "a Professional baseball player" -> "Professional Baseball Player").
- team_name: the team/employer named in the memo. league: the league (the memo's "Lending Area" or the league named alongside the team).
- loan_amount: the proposed facility / loan amount. interest_rate_pct: the stated interest rate. origination_fee_pct: the upfront/origination fee percentage.
- maturity_date: the proposed maturity date, formatted "YYYY-MM-DD". Null if not stated. (The memo usually has no funding/closing date — do not guess one.)
- loan_number: the loan or account number if shown (digits as a string); memos usually omit it.
